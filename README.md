Task Management App
A simple web-based task management app that allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks. Completed tasks are moved to the bottom of the task list and saved in the browser’s local storage for persistence across sessions.

Features
      -Add Tasks: Users can create new tasks by typing in the input field and clicking the add button.
      -Complete Tasks: Clicking on a task marks it as completed. Completed tasks are moved to the bottom of the list and visually distinguished with a strike-through effect.
      -Delete Tasks: Users can delete tasks permanently by clicking the delete icon next to each task.
      -Local Storage: Tasks are saved in the browser’s local storage, so the task list persists even after the page is refreshed or the browser is closed
